# Julian Popov, April 20, 2020

\[ One of the problems \] of Bulgaria is that it does not rule risks while fighting crises \. When there is no crisis\, waiting to come or create it to fight it \. But not with the risk\. Problem that painfully manifested in the context of the pandemic \. The Bulgarian government is very representative of the broad public attitude to risks and crises \(it is therefore a government because represents this well attitude \)\.

The infection is not controlled as a risk\, and as a crisis\. Instead of opening the parks and regulating movement in them \(risk\)\, entry into them \(crisis\) is prohibited \.

Instead of raising standards of education \(risk\)\, we give 5 levs to everyone will return \(crisis\) \.

Instead of developing preventively healthcare \(risk\)\, we are waiting for it to come time for surgery and cut \(crisis\)\.

Instead of controlling traffic on the streets to manage the risk of homicide disasters \, we wait for a tragedy and we react \.

Nobody insures themselves property against fire or flood\. Or robbery\.

Entering and leaving Sofia is not regulated \(risk\)\, but is allowed and then blocked \(crisis\)\.

When there is no crisis\, but there is a sharp feeling that something is wrong \, an emergency crisis conference is convened in the middle night to say that everything is ok \. We urgently want you announce that there is no fire \. We urgently want you announce that the deputies are alive and well \. We shouted you at midnight to tell you that the snowdrops not yet \_ bloomed \, but will bloom \. This is the case with clean air \, helicopter ambulances \, obesity of children \, depopulation of villages \, buying fighter jets and much more \. Thinking about risk is like fear of lessons\, instead of like insurance shelf \.

This one the attitude is deep \. We can trace it back and say that we have not yet shaken off the 1997 economic crisis\. Or in the past \- we have n't ruled for 45 years the country \. Or more further back \, Ottoman a time when no one knew what exactly is happening\, but everyone has developed a skill to get out and sneak \- like Andreshko or as leaving Sofia\. Maybe we are still learning to manage risks \. Maybe we live with the superstitious hope that nothing depends on us\.

# Stochastic or Determined World?

THESIS: " There is nothing accidental in this world\. The coincidence is due to ignorance of the relevant causal links\. The determinism or randomness of an event is reduced to the  __cognitive abilities of man __ "\(classical physics\, mathematics\)

ANTITHESIS: " According to Heisenberg  __'s uncertainty principle\, __ there are events whose causal relationships cannot be determined within a reasonable time for the event\. This principle means that there are events that cannot be made deterministic\, as a result of which they are unpredictable\. “\(Quantum physics\, engineering\)

Prof\. Georgi Chobanov\, VSIM: 16\, Ravda\, September 2016

SYNTHESIS \(Marchev\, Jr\.\):

Or there are nondeterministic events in which there are no causal links;

Or man's cognitive ability is insignificantly small compared to the all\-encompassing universe\.

In both cases\, the use of the better \(or only possible\) probabilistic mathematical apparatus is preferred\.

It is especially valid for phenomena of socio\-psychological nature\, which are much closer to quantum mechanics \(observer principle\, randomness \(or incomplete complexity\) of the behavior of objects\, uncertainty of the environment\, incomplete information\, non\- stationary \, etc\.\)\. At the same time\, it is a more pragmatic approach\, where one can always rely on concrete numerical results\. "

# PRESENTATION TITLE

# What is RISK ?

A revolutionary idea marking the border

between the age of modern progress and

The "dark" centuries of the past

Risk explanation philosophy:

Quantitative: " the best solutions are based on numbers"

OR

Psychologically : “ decisions are based

of expectations for the indefinite

future ”

T he spirit of the definition of risk is captured best by the Chinese symbols for risk \, which are reproduced here\.

The first symbol is for “ danger ”\, while the second is for “ Opportunity ”\, making risk a mix of danger and opportunity \.

It illustrates very clearly the tradeoff that every investor and business has to make \- between the higher rewards that come with the opportunity and the higher risk that has to be borne as a consequence of the danger \.

# What is a Risk?

A risk is  __ANYTHIN __ G that  __may __ affect the achievement of an organization's objectives\.

It is the  __UNCERTAINTY __ that surrounds future events and outcomes\.

It is the expression of the  __likelihood and impact __ of an event with the potential to influence the achievement of an organization's objectives\.

# Alternatively…

* Risk is a potential event with negative consequences that had not happened yet
  * Could also be an event with positive consequences
* A possibility of loss \- not the loss itself
  * A source of problem
  * Find the root cause and not the leaves
* Something that makes the project special
  * In the widest sense\, everything is a risk
  * Helps identify better ways of handling problems

# Key Terms

* Risk Tolerance \- The amount of acceptable risk
* Risk Adverse \- Someone that does not want to take risks
* Risk Factors
  * _Probability _ of occurrence
  * _Impact _ of event
  * _Range _ of outcomes
  * _Timing _ of event

# Categorizing Risk - Comprehensive

Political or Reputational Risk

Financial Risk

Service Delivery or Operational Risk

People / HR Risk

Information / Knowledge Risk

Strategic / Policy Risk

Stakeholder Satisfaction / Public Perception Risk

Legal / Compliance Risk

Technology Risk

Governance / Organizational Risk

Privacy Risk

Security Risk

Equity Risk

# Diversifiable vs Non Diversifiable

| Diversifiable Risk | Non-diversifiable risk |
| :-: | :-: |
| Risk that can be eliminated through diversification.<br />Also called Unsystematic Risk or controllable risk. | The risk inherent in the entire market or entire market segment.<br />Also known as "systematic risk" or "market risk." |
| It results from the occurrence of random events such as labor strikes, lawsuits, or loss of key accounts.<br />Business, liquidity, and default risks fall into this category.<br />It is assumed that any investor can create a portfolio in which this type of risk is completely eliminated through diversification.<br /> | Interest rates, recession and wars all represent sources of systematic risk because they will affect the entire market and cannot be avoided through diversification.<br />Whereas this type of risk affects a wide range of securities, unsystematic risk affects a very specific group of securities or an individual security.<br />Systematic risk can be mitigated only by being hedged. |

# Basic sources of risk & uncertainty

* Known knowns \(no risk / uncertainty\)
  * Facts\, outcomes or scenarios that we know with absolute certainty\, based on deterministic processes
* Unknown knowns
  * Certain facts that others know but we don't
  * Based on information asymmetry or poor communication
* Known unknowns
  * Potential facts\, outcomes\, scenarios that we are aware of\, but don't yet know with any certainty
  * Based on stochastic processes and known probability laws
* Unknown unknowns
  * Potential facts\, outcomes or scenarios that we are not yet aware of\, have not even considered
  * Often rare and extreme events or outliers \(“black swans”\)\, not considered due to lack of experience / imagination

# Variability

_Uncertainty _ occurs if at least two possible outcomes can arise out of an event\.

If one possible outcome\, then the outcome is known for certain\, so there is no risk\.

* House \- two possibilities \(in relation to fire\):
  * Catch fire or uncertainty exists
  * May not catch fire
* If the house\-owner certain that his house will not catch fire because it was entirely built using fire\-resistant materials\, then there is no risk associated with fire\.

Risk exists if there is uncertainty about the outcome of an event or an activity \.

The greater the number of outcomes from an event\, the greater would be the uncertainty and thus the risk\.

# St. Petersburg Paradox

You play a game of chance in which a one\-time entry fee is paid\. Then a fair coin is tossed again until the "round" falls\, ending the game\.

The table starts from BGN 1 and doubles for each "language"\. You win whatever is on the floor at the end of the game\.

For example: you win BGN 1 if the "round" falls on the first roll\, BGN 2 on the second\, BGN 4 on the third\, etc\. In short\, you will win BGN 2k − 1 if the coin is tossed k times before the "round" falls for the first time\. With a probability of 1/2 you win BGN 1; with probability 1/4 you win BGN 2\, with probability 1/8 you win BGN 4\, etc\.

What do you think would be a fair entry fee for you?

“The determination of the value of an item must not be based on the price\, but rather on the utility it yields…\. There is no doubt that a gain of one thousand ducats is more significant to the pauper than to a rich man though both gain the same amount\. ”

# Risk Utilities

* __Risk utility __ or  __risk tolerance __ is the amount of satisfaction or pleasure received from a potential payoff:
  * Utility rises at a decreasing rate for a person who is  __risk\-averse\.__
  * Those who are  __risk\-seeking __ have a higher tolerance for risk and their satisfaction increases when more payoff is at stake\.
  * The  __risk neutral approach __ achieves a balance between risk and payoff\.

# Experiment

Imagine the following situation: You have 100 euros and you are given a choice \- receive another 50 euros or toss a coin for a 50% chance to win 100 euros and 50% to win nothing\. What would you choose?

Significant majority of people choose the non\-risky alternative and get the sure 50 euro\, and by doing so they confirm the risk\-averse hypothesis

Now imagine a similar situation: You have 150 euros and you are given a choice \- lose 50 euros or toss a coin for a 50% chance to lose 100 euros and 50% to lose nothing\. What would you choose?

Significant majority of people choose the risky alternative and take risk for the chance of not losing anything\. So all of a sudden they become loss\-averse

# Risk-Taking in animal models

Bumblebees were foraging in an artificial field with:

Certain flowers: 3 μ l of nectar for sure\.

Risky flowers: 6 μ l \(50%\) or nothing \(50%\)\.

Bumblebees preferred certain flowers\.

Monkeys were required to choose between two options:

Certain circle: 30 ml of juice for sure\.

Risk circle: 50 ml \(50%\) or 10 ml \(50%\)\.

Monkeys preferred risky options\.

Decisions in Social Context

The nature of decision\-making fundamentally changes within social contexts\.

A paradigm that adequately represents rationality violation is the loss averse behavior\.

A perfectly rational responder should accept any offer randomly \(as the payoff is the same\)\.

In reality\, players systematically do not conform to these predictions \.

# Prospect theory

* The individual propensity to risk is
* Fundamental concept in economic
* Science\, especially in investment choice
* " rational man who avoids risk\."
* the leading paradigm \.
* It is a somewhat contradictory paradigm
* "Prospect theory"\, developed by Kahneman and Tversky
  * A large number of experiments with individual choice
  * OR the essence of man is irrational
  * OR the concept of a rational solution needs to be developed and supplemented
* The difficulty with changing the paradigm in the social sciences is that a sufficiently comprehensive and definitive experiment cannot be applied\.
